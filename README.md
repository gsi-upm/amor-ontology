# AMOR Ontology

# TODO: improve the documentation and reorganize the repo

## Introduction

## Generating documentation

Example WIDOCO command:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v ./src:/usr/local/widoco/in:Z -v ./doc:/usr/local/widoco/out:Z ghcr.io/dgarijo/widoco:latest -confFile in/widoco-amor-experiments-examples-config.properties -ontFile in/amor-experiments-examples.ttl -outFolder out/ontologies/amor/experiments/examples/doc -webVowl -rewriteAll
```

## Testing

There are some basic tests at `tests/`.
To run them:

```
pytest
```

## Research datasets

The goal of this experiment was to see the capabilities of AMOR ontology as a universal data schema used with real data extracted with existing algorithms.
